# Platform-Shooter-Game
A WIP game made using Pygame

This was a game I started when I was learning the Pygame module for Python. The end goal is for a platformer (Mario Bros kind of) 2D shooter. Did not finish it because I had some
issues with the hitbox that gave a weird teleportation glitch. I sort of forgot about it afterwards lol.
